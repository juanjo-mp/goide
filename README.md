# Compared to VS code

Following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MXIGYrMk80 with
https://golang.org/doc/code, this project has a couple of advantages:

* Docker image streamlines setup. No hoop jumping to install the entire environment assuming you have Docker and `make` installed
* Efficient vim key bindings, use `vimtutor` to learn how to edit with it
* Can be used easily upon remote environments, a **terminal environment** is all you need
* `:Gotests` makes it easier to generate tests
